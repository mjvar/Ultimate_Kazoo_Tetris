Final project for Intro to CS Section 5 (Matthew Varona &amp; Shaurya Singh)

Tetris is a a classic puzzle game where players are asked to stack blocks of varying shapes and sizes.

Blocks will descend from the top of the screen, and the player must move or rotate them as they fall. When a complete row of blocks is formed, the row disappears and points are added to the playerâ€™s score. More points are given if multiple rows are formed at the same time (i.e. a combo). In classic implementations of Tetris, a single row formed is worth 100 points, a 4-row combo is worth 800 points, and multiple 4-row combos in succession are worth 1200 points each.

The game ends when the screen fills up and there is no longer room for blocks to fall.
