Final project for Intro to CS Section 5 (Matthew Varona &amp; Shaurya Singh)

Tetris is a a classic puzzle game where players are asked to stack blocks of varying shapes and sizes.

Our interpretation of Tetris adds Arcade Mode, which is a punishing new game mode that penalizes the player for mistakes.
This edition also features an originally arranged kazoo soundtrack by kazoo virtuoso Matthew Varona.
